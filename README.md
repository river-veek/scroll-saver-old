# Scroll Saver (V0.5.0)
A Google Chrome extension that allows a user to save the locations of the scroll bar on a webpage or file.

## How To Use
1. Turn on the Scroll Saver Chrome Extension from the extensions icon (the puzzle-piece icon located to the right of the address bar.
2. Refresh your page.
3. You should now see a transparent button appear near the top-right corner of your browser window. To save your current location, simply click the "Save Location" button.
4. Upon saving your first location, a dropdown menu should appear underneath the "Save Location" button. This is where you can select previously saved scroll bar (SB) locations to return to.
5. After selecting a SB location from the dropdown, your window will change to that location on the webpage/file.

## Functionality
- Save multiple SB locations that can be returned to at a later time.
- View all saved SB locations from the provided dropdown menu.

### In-Progress Functionality
- Customize the color, size, name of a SB marker.
- View all saved SB locations at once from extension popup.

**Notes**:
- This extension will only work for the Google Chrome browser.
- This project is currently a work in progress; functionality subject to change.

**Known Bugs**:
- Scroll Saver does not function properly when viewing PDFs.
- Selecting the same saved location more than once will not bring the  
  user back to that location.
    - To circumvent this, select another location and then click on the previous  
      location.
