# Scroll Saver
A Google Chrome extension that allows a user to save the locations of the scroll bar on a webpage or file.

## Functionality
- Save multiple scroll bar (SB) locations with markers that can be returned to at a later time.
- Simply click on a saved SB marker to return to that spot on a webpage/file.

### In-Progress Functionality
- Customize the color, size, name of a SB marker.
- View all saved SB locations at once from extension popup.

**Notes**:
- This extension will only work for the Google Chrome browser.
- This repository is currently a work in progress; functionality subject to change.

**Known Bugs**:
- Scroll Saver does not function properly when viewing PDFs.
- Selecting the same saved location option 2 or more times will not bring the  
  user to that location.
    - To combat this, select another location and then click on the previous  
      location.
