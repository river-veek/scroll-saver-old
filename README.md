# Scroll Saver
A Google Chrome extension that allows a user to save the locations of the scroll bar on a webpage or file.

## (Future) Functionality
- Save multiple scroll bar (SB) locations with markers that can be returned to at a later time.
- Customize the color, size, name of a SB marker.
- View all saved SB locations at once in a scroll marker bank.
- Simply click on a saved SB marker to return to that spot on a webpage/file.

**Notes**: 
- This extension will only work for the Google Chrome browser.
- This repository is currently a work in progress; functionality subject to change.
